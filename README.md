# REALISTIC-RANDOM-FACE-IMAGE-GENERATION-USING-VANILA-GAN

In the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence, the creation of fake face images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has come to be as an exciting and quickly developing field. Fake face image production has received a lot of interest due to the rising need for realistic and high-quality synthetic images, and it has found use in a number of fields including entertainment, computer graphics, and privacy protection. With the development of GANs, the field of image synthesis has undergone a revolutionary change thanks to the availability of a strong framework for producing images with exceptional visual integrity and realism. A discriminator and a generator are the two competing neural networks that make up GANs. While the discriminator network is trained to distinguish between actual and fake images, the generator network tries to create fake images that mimic real photos. These networks learn to enhance their performance iteratively through an adversarial training process, leading to the development of increasingly convincing and undetectable false face images.
